# Portable-Python-3.2.5.1

This repository contains a collection of class assignment programs and utilities developed using Portable Python 3.2.5.1.

**Note:**  
Portable Python is no longer maintained or available for download. The scripts in this repository were originally developed for that environment and may require refactoring or updates to run on current versions of Python or other portable distributions.
